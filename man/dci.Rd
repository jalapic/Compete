\section{Further details}{

The DCI represents the proportion of occurrences of a behavior that occurs across all dyads
in a group from the individual within each dyad performing the behavior with a higher frequency (H)
to the individual within each dyad performing the behavior with a lower frequency (L).
It is calculated by averaging the following formula across all dyads: DCI = (H - L)/(H + L).
The DCI ranges from 0 (no directional asymmetry) to 1 (completely unidirectional).
